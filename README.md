# **Overview**

**Him brings the age-old myth of Herobrine to life. Designed as a subtle horror mod, it introduces a variety of haunting features to make your Minecraft experience unsettling and eerie, all while staying true to the original Herobrine mythos. This means no crazy boss fights, no giant structure generation or overpowered weapons and armor. He will stalk you. He will manipulate the world around you. He will stay in the shadows.**

I recommend playing with [Modern Beta](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-beta), you can generate old Alpha worlds with it to add to the classic spooky factor.
Make sure your **ambient** audio level is high!

## **Future Updates**

I think I've added everything I wanted to at the moment, if you have any suggestions or if you encounter any issues, please let me know. I haven't been able to do very extensive bug testing. I'll try to update the mod as my schedule permits. I may port to Forge in the future but no promises for now.
