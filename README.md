# **Overview**

**Him brings the age-old myth of Herobrine to life. Designed as a subtle horror mod, it introduces a variety of creepy features to make your Minecraft experience unsettling and eerie, all while staying true to the original Herobrine mythos. This means no crazy boss fights, no giant structure generation or overpowered weapons and armor. He will stalk you. He will manipulate the world around you. He will stay in the shadows.**

**CONFIG** numbers are a range (min, max), the default values will cause more of a slow burn!

Make sure your **ambient** audio level is high!

## **Future Updates**

I think I've added everything I wanted to at the moment, if you have any suggestions or if you encounter any issues, please let me know as I haven't been able to do very extensive bug testing. I'll try to update the mod as my schedule permits.
